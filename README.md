This command extends cargo with the capability to directly run `valgrind` on any crate executable.
The output of valgrind is then used to mark the binary as pass/fail.

This command should not be necessary for ordinary Rust programs, especially if you are only using safe Rust code.
But if you do FFI-related stuff (either by simply using a FFI-binding crate or because you are developing a safe wrapper for such FFI bindings) it may be really helpful to check, whether the memory usages across the FFI borders are correct.

## Usage
A typical mistake would be:
```rust
use std::ffi::CString;
use std::os::raw::c_char;

extern "C" {
    fn puts(s: *const c_char);
}

fn main() {
    let string = CString::new("Test").unwrap();

    let ptr = string.into_raw();
    unsafe { puts(ptr) };

    // unsafe { CString::from_raw(ptr) };
}
```
The memory of the variable `string` will never be freed.
If you run `cargo valgrind run` in your shell, it detects the leak:
```bash
$ cargo valgrind run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.01s
     Running `target/debug/cstring`

Un-commenting the `unsafe { CString::from_raw(ptr) };` re-takes the memory and frees it correctly.
`cargo valgrind run` will compile the binary for you and won't detect a leak, since there is no leak anymore.

If you would like to pass flags to valgrind (for example to run an alternate subtool), you can set the `VALGRINDFLAGS` environment variable to a space-delimited list of valid Valgrind options.

`cargo valgrind` automatically applies some suppressions for wrongly reported leaks within the Rust standard library.
This makes the tool more powerful than a normal valgrind invocation.

Note, that in some cases, the normal destructors are not run, which can lead to memory leaks reported (as the memory _is_ actually not freed up).
This typically happens when executing [`std::process::exit()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.91.0/std/process/fn.exit.html), which does _not_ run any `Drop` impls of alive variables, thus leaking the memory.
Either explicitly drop all variables before running `std::process::exit()` or, preferrably, migrate to returning a `Result` from main, which gracefully handles the dropping/resource releasing like normal functions do.

_Note_: users of `cargo-valgrind` version 1.x should mind the changed command line.
Previously there was a `cargo valgrind` subcommand, that replaced the `cargo run` or `cargo test` commands.
Now the command line is `cargo valgrind <command>`, where `<command>` can be any normal cargo subcommand.

# Installation
## Requirements
You need to have `valgrind` installed and in the `PATH` (you can test this by running `valgrind --help` in your shell).

You'll also need to have `cargo` installed and in the `PATH`, but since this is a cargo subcommand, you will almost certainly have it already installed.

## Install the binary
### Use pre-built binaries
Head over to the [latest release] and download the artifact for your platform.
The binary has to be extracted into the `.cargo`-directory, typically under `$HOME/.cargo`.
Note, that it is not possible to directly run the program itself, as it must be invoked via `cargo valgrind`, so it must be located in a directory, `cargo` searches its subcommands in.

[latest release]: https://github.com/jfrimmel/cargo-valgrind/releases/latest

### From Source
Run the following command to install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-valgrind):
```bash
$ cargo install cargo-valgrind
```
This will install the latest official released version.

If you want to use the latest changes, that were not yet published to `crates.io`, you can install the binary from the git-repository like this:
```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/jfrimmel/cargo-valgrind
```
